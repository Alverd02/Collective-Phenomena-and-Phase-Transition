# Ising Model
The report called "Model_de_Ising.pdf" is in catalan. I'm going to make a short version here so you can understand what's going on.
## -Physics behind the program
The Ising model consists of discrete variables located in a grid (2D) which represent the spin of the particles with values +1 or -1.

The Hamiltionian of this system is:

$$ H = -J\sum_{ij}S_iS_j - h\sum_{i=1}^NS_i  $$
